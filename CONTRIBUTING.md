# Contributing to the Project
There is obviously a lot of work required to get this project off the ground, and get the PortableSDR into as many hands as want it. In order to help coordinate every hand that wants to help develop the projcet, here are a few guidelines we ask the community to follow.

Note: It is not necessary to be a licensed ham operator in order to work on this project, but it is highly encouraged that contributors contact their local ham radio club for assistance in obtaining a license to transmit. 

Another Note: All pull requests and branches shall written in a professional and friendly manner. This extends to any discussion within a PR or branch. No attitudes on the airwaves!

## How to Contribute

Glad you asked! There are always ways for individuals to contribute with developing, testing, and planning new features for the project. 

Here are some helpful resources:
- For discussion of features, use the Discussions tab in Github
- Bugs? Report them in the `Issues` tab

## Testing
  For hardware testing, you may need to order a board and populate it with the BOM. Two places to order PCBs that come to mind are [OSHPark](oshpark.com) and [PCB:NG](pcb.ng), though PCB:NG might be better for a production run scenario instead of just test boards.

  For software testing, refer to the build instructions found in the `Documentation` folder for how to run smoke testing on code. Soon there will also be an automated testing route that contributors can take advantage of using the GitHub `Actions` section.

## Submitting Changes
Please submit a GitHub Pull Request along with a clear list of what changes you have made.Additionally, if your PR is related to a particular project task, please reference that task so appropriate tracking can be done. 

If possible, please submit a few sentences regarding larger commits. One-line messages are fine for smaller changes, but bigger changes should be formatted as follows:
```bash
    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit" -m "A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
```

## Coding Conventions
TBD
